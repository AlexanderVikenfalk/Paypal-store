#### About this project: 
This project was made as a school project to try out buidlind a MVC in asp.net and integrating paypal services into a made up web store.

#### Technologies used: 
* **C#/ .NET** for backend. 
* **CSS** for design.
* **HTML** for layout.
* **JS/ Jquery** for effects and functionality. 

#### How to use this service ####
1. Go to http://alexander-paypalstore20170226075102.azurewebsites.net/
2. Type in a number in the input box.
3. Cick on the magnifying glass.
4. Wait for the site to redirect to Paypal.

Since focus was on backend and the paypal integation, I havent put much effort into making it responsive, well designed or even user friendly (but the intended function works :-) ). No redirect page was made, so after completed buy it will redirect to index-page again.
